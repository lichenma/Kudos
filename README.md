Another full-stack application created to help me familiarize myself with building Web Applications. Previously, the Javalon web application introduced me to the `Spring` backend framework 
and the `AngularJS` front-end framework. Given the popularity of `Python` and `React` I decided to pick up a new project to familiarize myself with web application development using 
these languages. 


## Getting Started

To Run the program, navigate under \venv to find the Car.py file. Then using command prompt or a Python IDE, specify the python interpreter and run the Car.py file. 
On Windows command prompt for example you can run the following: 

```
C:\path to\python.exe C:\path to\venv\Car.py
```


### Prerequisites

A python interpreter is required to run the program ideally the most recent version. For testing I am working with the following version

```
Python Version 3.7
```


## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Python IDE
