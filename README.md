Another full-stack application created to help me familiarize myself with building Web Applications. Previously, the Javalon web application introduced me to the `Spring` backend framework 
and the `AngularJS` front-end framework. Given the popularity of `Python` and `React` I decided to pick up a new project to familiarize myself with web application development using 
these languages.
