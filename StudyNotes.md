# CRUD Flask React Application 

Acknowlegements - this application is inspired by the design provided by Kleber Correia at okta 

Flask will be used in this project to quickly put together a REST API, meanwhile React is a declarative, efficicent and flexible JavaScript library for building the front-End. It faciliates the creation of a complex, interactive and stateful User Interface from small and isolated pieces of code called components. 


The first part of building this application will be creating the back-End REST API using Python: 

Ensure that Python 3 is installed using
```
python --version
``` 

The REST API will use some third-party libraries to help connect to a database, create schemas for the models, and validate the incoming requests. 


To assist with this, Python has a powerful tool to manage dependencies called `pipenv`. Ensure that `pipenv` is installed on the machine using pip installer: 

```
pip install --user pipenv   
```

Pipenv is a tool that provides all necessary means to create a virtual environment for a Python project. It automatically manages project packages through the `Pipfile` as the user installs or uninstalls packages. 


With pip insalled we will use the following as the directory for backend code:
